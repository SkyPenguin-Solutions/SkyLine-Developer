This document contains information on what needs to be worked on from the most primary to the least primary

- Code Organization:
        The code organization for SkyLine is fucking garbage and needs to be fixed, make sure to organize, document and erase functions that are not used 

        * Sector code into sections 
        * Add a note block for every single file of direct implementation 

- Error System:
        The error system for SkyLine is fucking garbage and needs to be fixed as well, make sure to implement calling a tree, a function that can automate 
        the tree output, a function that can check for modifications to the error systems and apply them accordingly, also work on implementing all 3 forms 
        of error system output.

- File System:
        The file system of SkyLine is very damaged and broken and needs to be fixed a little bit. Below are the changes to make 

        Change the checkers -> Change and make the functions to check the data of the files alot better

        Change the support  -> make sure to support multiple files such as .sl, .skyline, .SkyLine, .csc and other various file types

- Standard Library:
        The standard library for skyline needs alot of work especially the ones currently being worked on.

        Add security measures -> Make sure these functions are checked for every possible thing to prevent crashing 

        Add more libraries    -> libraries like HTTP, JSON, XML, Net, Conn, Socket, IoT, Forensics, Quantum all need to be added before the end of the month


- SLC::System   :

    The SkyLine configuration language also needs to be worked on in multiple area's such as file extension checking, flags 
    that allow you to run it individually as a program and even a call that allows you to work with the actual configuration 
    in a single environment. Also allow for the registry of libraries with SL.

    The SLC system should work with SkyLine and should not be the biggest issues
